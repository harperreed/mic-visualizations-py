# üé® Audio Visualizations üé∂

Welcome to the **Audio Visualizations** repository! Here, you will find an exciting collection of Python scripts that generate captivating visual representations of audio data using the Pygame library. Each visualization is designed to respond dynamically to the audio's frequency domain data (FFT), creating an immersive experience for viewers.

## üìú Summary of Project

This project aims to bridge sound and sight by creating stunning graphics based on audio signals. By utilizing **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** data, each script generates unique visual patterns that fluctuate with the audio's frequencies and amplitudes. Whether you're looking for mesmerizing circular designs, fractal trees, or star fields, this repository has something for everyone!

### Features:
- Interactive visualizations responding to audio input
- Multiple visualization styles, including:
  - Circular patterns
  - Fractal trees
  - Particle systems
  - Ripple effects
  - Spectrum bars
  - Spiral graphics
  - Star fields
- Built using Python and Pygame

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your system along with the Pygame library. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harperreed/audio-visualizations.git
   cd audio-visualizations
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Pygame installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame numpy
   ```
   
3. **Run a Visualization Script:**
   Choose any of the visualization scripts in the `visualizations` directory and execute it. For example:
   ```bash
   python visualizations/circular.py
   ```

4. **Input Audio:**
   Make sure to configure the audio input source correctly, as the visualizations are designed to react to audio data.

5. **Enjoy!** üéâ
